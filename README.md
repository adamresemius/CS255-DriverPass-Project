# CS255-DriverPass-Project
DriverPass was created in my CS255 class to show the skills that I have developed in system analysis and design. 
For this calss I have created diagrams for a LMS. This LMS will be a industry leading learning software that allows
students to learn about drivers education through online instead of inclass. Students will still have instructors
that will lead them to learn with behind the wheel classes. However this takes the learning and classroom parts of 
drivers education and makes it so students can be flexible with their times.
