# Welcome to DriverPass!

DriverPass is a web-based Learning Management System (LMS) that was created to showcase the system analysis and design skills that I have developed in my CS255 class. The LMS is designed to be an industry-leading learning software that allows students to learn about driver's education online, rather than in a traditional classroom setting.

The goal of DriverPass is to provide students with a flexible and convenient way to learn about driver's education. With DriverPass, students will be able to access course materials and complete assignments online, at their own pace and on their own schedule. They will still have access to instructors for behind-the-wheel classes, but the classroom portion of driver's education will be available online.

The system architecture of DriverPass is based on various software design patterns and best practices. It includes several key modules, such as the Student Management System, Course Management System, and Instructor Management System. These modules work together seamlessly to provide students with a comprehensive learning experience.

DriverPass also includes various tools and features to help students learn effectively. For example, it includes an interactive course dashboard, a progress tracker, and a personalized study plan. These features help students stay on track and make progress towards their learning goals.
